      Hi! I’m Sam Eastwood*. Currently, I’m a third-year undergraduate Computer
      Science student at the 
      <a href="https://www.cs.york.ac.uk/"> University of York</a>. 
      I’m interested in front-end web
      development (I did a whole internship in it!) but generally, I like
      solving puzzles and coding pretty visual things.
    </p>
    <p>Here are a few things I’ve worked with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Python, Java, Typescript/Javascript, HTML & (S)CSS</li>
      <li>React with Redux</li>
      <li>Git, TravisCI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Besides being an aspiring software engineer, I also happen to be an avid
      baker and a sporadic artist. On weekends you’re likely to find me making
      <i>some</i> kind of mess, whether that be with batters and doughs or inks
      and paints...
    </p>

      *I am sometimes referred to as Tai Eastwood, where Tai is my mother's
      surname. It's, uh, complicated.

      <b>Academic:</b> During my first two years at university, my projects and assessments have mainly been in Python
      and Java. Other languages I have some knowledge in include: C, Scheme, Haskell, Ada, and Prolog. I also have
      experience with SQL, both from the databases module and from my A-Level project.

      Front end web development using Typescript with React/Redux. Collaborated in an agile team on
      a relatively new project (which also happened to be a&nbsp;
      <a href="http://ktp.innovateuk.org/">KTP</a>).
      Also participated in various IBM events, such as the global&nbsp;
      <a href="https://developer.ibm.com/callforcode/">Call for Code</a> hackathon challenge

      my team won a prize, in both years we entered!)
