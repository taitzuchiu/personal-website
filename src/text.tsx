      Hi! I’m Sam Eastwood*. Currently, I’m a third-year undergraduate Computer
      Science student at the University of York. I’m interested in front-end web
      development (I did a whole internship in it!) but generally, I like
      solving puzzles and coding pretty visual things.
    </p>
    <p>Here are a few things I’ve worked with:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Python, Java, Typescript/Javascript, HTML & (S)CSS</li>
      <li>React with Redux</li>
      <li>Git, TravisCI</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Besides being an aspiring software engineer, I also happen to be an avid
      baker and a sporadic artist. On weekends you’re likely to find me making
      <i>some</i> kind of mess, whether that be with batters and doughs or inks
      and paints...
    </p>

      *I am sometimes referred to as Tai Eastwood, where Tai is my mother's
      surname. It's, uh, complicated.
